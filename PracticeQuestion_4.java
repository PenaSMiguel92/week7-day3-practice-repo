	 * Prompt: Given an array of integers, nums, and a target, write
	 * 		an algorithm which return the indices of the two numbers
	 * 		in the array which add up to the target. You can assume
	 * 		that each input will have a single solution. Additionally
	 * 		you may not use the same element twice.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * 		INPUT: nums = [2,7,11,15], target=9
	 * 		OUTPUT: [0,1] (because nums[0] is 2, and nums[1] is 7 || nums[0] + nums[1] == 9)
